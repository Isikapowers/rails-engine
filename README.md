# rails-engine
"Rails Engine" is a Rails-based API which mimics an e-commerce platform reporting tool as an API. Users can query and store merchants and items, and retrieve information about an item's merchant, or a list of a merchant's items. Users can also run one of several "business intelligence" endpoints to do rich reporting using ActiveRecord queries.
